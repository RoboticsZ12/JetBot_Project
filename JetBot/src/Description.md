## Jetbot Code & Walk Through Guide

# Code:
The code utilized for this project was fully reliant on the use of Python. The reasoning for this decision is the languages powerful capabilities of working fluently with robotic systems. Although other langueges such as C++ may be faster, Python incorporates a more robust algorithm for the entire system. For this reason, Python will be utilized for this project. 

As previously stated, the provided files are a type of walk through guide for the Jetbot system. Most of the code is provided on the Jetbot website, however some modifications were made to the code in order for the program to run smoothly for our own project needs.
