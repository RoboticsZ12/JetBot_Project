## BLOCKED

This file contains all the images of the "blocked" points on the obstacle course. These blocked locations include obstacles, rode curves, and stop lights. By taking these images, we can communicate with the jetbot that if the camera reads a certain image, such as an obstacle, then the jetbot would be commanded to stop movement.
