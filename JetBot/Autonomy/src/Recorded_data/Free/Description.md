This file contains all the necessary images to inform the compiler of the "safe" positions for the jetbot to travel. These images are used to compare with the "blocked" images of the camera. Basically works as an 'if' statement. If this specific obstacle is seen, then stop the robot, however, if a specific image of the road is seen, then the jetbot would continue on its designated path.
